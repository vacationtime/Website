    <h1>How do people try?</h1>
    <p>Effort is something that people lack very often and often don't realize
    . It is as elusive for some and plentiful for others. This is what I believe
    to be natural talent, the ability to try. There are many things that stop us
    from trying to the best of our ability. They are the things that everyone
    experiences so no one takes them into account. Examples of this are tiredness,
    other peoples expectations, what is considered normal or acceptable. These
    are concepts that are imposed upon us a people of the western society. As long
    as you're not dying of a preventable disease and you have a job/car you're okay
    in a lot of peoples eyes so anything else is unnecessary making it easy to not try
    a new skill or trade.</p>

    <p>I write this as someone that has always been slothful so to expose what I've found
    that has stopped me from reaching my full potential. When you become the best amongst
    your peers at something you lose a motivating factor for improving at that something.
    This is can be avoided by considering the best of best your peers and then aspiring to
    improving to their level at some point. This comes with it's own set of issues but if your
    goal is to be best you can be or you believe that your talent is that of the best I believe
    the issues that arise are easier to deal with. I will try to outline what I believe to be problem
    with this thought process and how I think about them.</p>

    <p>First thing would be self-doubt because of the lack of confidence that your initial thought was correct, that being
      "I can be the best". A common place phrase is "Be the best you, you can be" or something along those lines. But I believe
      that to be a flawed phrase. Reason being that the best you can be is the best and even beyond achieving the pinacle of whatever
      you're doing it can be done better than anyone had ever conceived. This is because we as people only think in terms of things that
      have been done and we think about things in a romantasized way that the rational sucession of improvement. What I'm trying to put
      into words here is that the best is not static and human improvement is something that can't stopped. Trying to write about it now
      I'm only picturing in my mind basketball throughout time where it is dicussed who is the best of all time based on results. But that
      is a flawed system because the progression of what is the peak performance has crept forward with the coming of every great player.
      Aspiring players then mimic their success as well as use their natural talent to develop their own play that could be equal or surpass
      the previous best of all time. Holding on to a fleeting rank of number one in time when we as human have only 82.30 years on this earth
      if we're lucky is not the correct way of assessing peak performance. I'll try to find what I believe to be what the mentality should be.
      It was a visualization of what a PHD thesis paper is supposed to do for human understanding.

    <p>
      This what I believe to be how every thing known has been developed and everything that will be understood will be understood. That is pretty
      obvious writing down but I don't think that concept has been applied to self improvement on a smalle scale than a PHD. For writing this right
      now I gain knowledge that I didn't have before about how to format a website, write a self directed piece, and putting my thoughts out in the
      world. If I don't lose my reason for putting effort into this I can be the best at anything and so can anyone else. I'll try to define what I
      believe the "Best means to me" but I think I should end this here.
