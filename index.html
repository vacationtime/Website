    <b>Pillars of Creation</b>
    <img src="images/space/pillars.jpg" align="right">
    <br />
    These are pillars of cool molecular hydrogen and dust that are quite large. The left one is 4 light-years long and it's being here evaporated by other stars that
    are closish. There's little tentacles at the top of the left one that are the size of our solar system and they are collapsing on themselves making new stars.
     This might not last but as long as those collapses keep drawing mass they will grow. Seems like they're already gone though because of a shockwave produced by a
     super nova. RIP on space dust.

    <b>Horse Head Nebula</b>
    <img src="images/space/horsehead.jpg" align="Left">
    <br />
    This one is just a dark cloud in front of a bright nebula behind it. I don't really think it looks like a horse. I'd say it's a pick axe nebula.

    <b>Pickaxe Nebula</b>
    This is the pickaxe nebula. You can see it because it makes a silhouette of itself contrasted against the bright nebula behind it.

    <b>Crab Nebula</b>
    <img src="images/space/crab.jpg" align="right">
    <br />
    Dude in 1840 the 3rd Earl of Rosse saw this and drew a crab so now that is it's name. It's a supernova remnant and #chinese astronomers in 1054 had the record.
    That is pretty dope that there is record of that, hopefully I can find more on that record and write about that here. There is a neutron star that is only 28-30 KM
    accross at the center of this bad boy. You can see it in quote favourable conditions unquote with binoculars. So it's pretty bright cause it's 6.5k light years from earth.
    It is an explosion after all so it's still doing some expanding so keep an eye on this one.

  <div class="boxedL">
    <b>Butterfly Nebula</b>
    <img src="images/space/butterfly.jpg" align="Left">
    <br />
    This is a spicy one, if you want to take a bite you need to heat proof dat mouth. It is an estimated 250,000 degrees because of the central dying star it gives out a lot of
    heat. This one is 4,000 light years away.

  <div class="boxedR">
    <b>Crab Nebula</b>
    <img src="images/space/saturnaurora.jpg" align="right">
    <br />A lot of planets have auroras not just Earth. From the limited research I've done it seems like it isn't caused by the same thing as our auroras. But
    it's still pretty cool that planets light up at the top and bottom. Very living planet type of stuff.
